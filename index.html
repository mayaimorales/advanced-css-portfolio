            <p>
                My name is Maya Morales. I am a 21 year-old student and aspiring software developer. I am currently pursuing a B.A. in Communications at California State University, Bakersfield, but would also love a career in coding!
                Aside from coding and school, I enjoy music, vinyl collecting, and art. Here is some of my work that I have so far!
